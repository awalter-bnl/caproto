The threading client is a high-performance client that uses Python's built-in
threading module to manage concurrency.

Tutorial
========

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    run_example('caproto.ioc_examples.random_walk')

In a separate shell, start one of caproto's demo IOCs.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python3 -m caproto.ioc_examples.random_walk
    PVs: ['random_walk:dt', 'random_walk:x']

Connect
-------

Now, in Python we will talk to it using caproto's threading client. Start by
creating a :class:`Context`.

.. ipython:: python

    from caproto.threading.client import Context
    ctx = Context()

The :class:`Context` object tracks the state of connections in progress.
We can use it to request new connections. Formulating requests for many PVs in
a large batch is efficient. In this example we'll just ask for two PVs.

.. ipython:: python

    x, dt = ctx.get_pvs('random_walk:x', 'random_walk:dt')

:meth:`Context.get_pvs`  accepts an arbitrary number of PV names and
immediately returns a collection of :class:`PV` objects representing each name.
In a background thread, the Context searches for an EPICS server that provides
that PV name and then connects to it. The PV object displays its connection
state:

.. ipython:: python

    dt

The Context displays aggregate information about the state of all connections.

.. ipython:: python

    ctx

Read and Write
--------------

Now, to read a PV:

.. ipython:: python

    res = dt.read()
    res

This object is a human-friendly representation of the server's response. The
raw bytes of that response are:

.. ipython:: python

    bytes(res)

Access particular fields in the response using attribute ("dot") access on ``res``.

.. ipython:: python

    res.data

.. note::

    **Performance Note**

    The underlying metadata and data are stored in efficient, contiguous-memory
    data structures.

    .. ipython:: python

        res.header  # a ctypes.BigEndianStructure
        res.buffers  # a collection of one or more buffers

    They were received directly from the socket into these structure with no
    intermediate copies. Accessing the ``res.data`` --- which returns a
    ``numpy.ndarray`` or ``array.array`` --- provides a view onto that same
    memory with no copying (if the data was received from the socket all at
    once) or one copy (if the data bridged multiple receipts).

Let us set the value to ``1``.

.. ipython:: python

    dt.write([1])

Subscribe ("Monitor")
---------------------

Let us now monitor a channel. The server updates the ``random_walk:x`` channel
periodically. (The period is set by ``random_walk:dt``.) We can subscribe to
updates and fan them out to one or more user-defined callback functions.
The user-defined function msut accept one positional argument.

.. ipython:: python

    responses = []
    def f(response):
        responses.append(response)

.. ipython:: python

    sub = x.subscribe()
    token = sub.add_callback(f)

The ``token`` is just an integer which we can use to unsubscribe later. We can
define a second callback

.. ipython:: python

    values = []
    def g(response):
        values.append(response.data[0])

and add it to the same subscription, putting no additional load on the network.

.. ipython:: python

    sub.add_callback(g)

After some time has passed, we will have accumulated some responses.

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    import time; time.sleep(5)

.. ipython:: python

    len(responses)
    values

At any point we can remove a specific callback function

.. ipython:: python

    sub.remove_callback(token)

or clear all the callbacks on a subscription

.. ipython:: python

    sub.clear()

In order to minimize load on the network, a :class:`Subscription` waits to
request updates from the server until the first user callback is added. Thus,
the first callback added by the user is guaranteed to get the first response
received from the server. If all user callbacks are later removed, either
explicitly (via ``remove_callback`` or ``clear``) or implicitly via Python
garbage collection, the Subscription automatically cancels future updates from
the server.  If a callback is then later added, the Subscription silently
re-initiates updates. All of this is transparent to the user.

.. warning::

    The callback registry in :class:`Subscription`  only holds weak references
    to the user callback functions. If there are no other references to the
    function, it will be silently removed and garbage collected. Therefore,
    constructions like this do not work:

    .. code-block:: python

        sub.add_callback(lambda response: print(response.data))

    The lambda function will be promptly removed and garbage collected. This
    can be surprising, but it is a standard approach for avoiding the
    accidental costly accumulation of abandoned callbacks.

Go Idle
-------

Once created, PVs are cached for the lifetime of the :class:`Context` and
returned again to the user if a PV with the same name and priority is
requested. In order to reduce the load on the network, a PV can be temporarily
made "idle" (disconnected). It will silently, automatically reconnect the next
time it is used.

.. ipython:: python

    x
    x.go_idle()
    x
    x.read()
    x

Notice that when the PV was read it automatically reconnected, requiring no
action from the user.

The ``go_idle()`` method is merely a *request* and is not guaranteed to have
any effect. If a PV has active subscriptions, it will ignore the request: it
must stay active to continue servicing user callbacks. Therefore, it is safe
call ``go_idle()`` on any PV at any time, knowing that the PV will decline to
disconnect if it is being actively used and that, if it is currently unused, it
will transparently reconnect the next time it is used.

Loggers for Debugging
---------------------

Various Python loggers are available. They inherit Python's default of
silencing log messages below the WARNING level. To receive more information
about a given PV, turn up the verbosity of the ``PV.log`` logger:

.. code-block:: python

    x.log.setLevel('DEBUG')

To see the individual requests sent and responses received by the TCP
connection support ``x`` (and any other PVs on that same Virtual Circuit) use
the ``PV.circuit_manager.log`` logger:

.. code-block:: python

    x.circuit_manager.log.setLevel('DEBUG')

For updates about the overall state of the Context (number of unanswered
searches still await responses, etc.) use ``Context.log``:

.. code-block:: python

    ctx.log.setLevel('DEBUG')

or, equivalently:

.. code-block:: python

    x.context.log.setLevel('DEBUG')

Finally, to turn on *maximal* debugging, use:

.. code-block:: python

    import logging
    logging.getLogger('caproto').setLevel('DEBUG')

For more information see :ref:`loggers`.

.. ipython:: python
    :suppress:

    # Clean up IOC processes.
    for p in processes:
        p.terminate()
    for p in processes:
        p.wait()
